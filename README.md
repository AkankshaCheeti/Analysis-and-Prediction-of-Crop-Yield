# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Crop-Yield

In this project, Several datasets of rainfall, temperature, pesticides and reliable information about crop yield history were used to produce predictions for the future.
Data Set Source: 
Pesticide, Yield - FAO(http://www.fao.org/home/en/)
Temperature and Rain Fall - World Bank Open Data(https://data.worldbank.org/)

Data: Data is merged from different datasets for crop yield prediction. The datasets merged are yield, rainfall, pesticides and temperature datasets. It is done using Year and Area features which are the common attributes in all the datasets.
